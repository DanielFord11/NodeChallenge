## Description
This project uses AI and PS5 technology to remote control any car to take you to work while you sleep

## Installation
You need to wire a PS5 Controller to your main steering console then connect it to bluetooth and download the app to your car

## Usage
Once installed hit record on your app then drive to work. Once you have arrive hit stop. Then next time you drive to work just it play or schedule a play. The app will then control your car to make all of the movements from the previous recording exactly. There shouldnt be any problems or safety concerns with that. However, we are not liable for any death or maming that may result from the use of this app
